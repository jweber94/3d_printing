# 3D Printing Repository
This repository contains my stuff related to 3D printing, e.g. calibration prints that I will occationally use, cura profiles that worked particulary good or some markdown documents that will persist some knowlage that I got over the time.

## My Printer
Currently I have a Creality [Ender 3 S1](https://www.creality.com/de/products/creality-ender-3-s1-3d-drucker) for 3D printing. I also have the 5W laser cutter/engraver which I will probably use more often in the future.
